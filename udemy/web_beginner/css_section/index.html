                <p>McFly! (Jennifer jumps at this. Marty turns around to see his boss.) Oh! Fujitsu-san! Konnichi wa! McFly! I was monitoring that scan you just interfaced. You are terminated! Terminated! No, no! It wasn't my fault sir, it was Needles, Needles was behind the whole thing! Yeah. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Um, well it's a Delorean, right? Bare with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.</p>

                <p>Doc, is that a deâ€¦ (The man points the gun and fires. He severs the rope that is holding Marty up and Marty falls to the ground taking a very deep breath. The gang looks at the man for the first time and raise their guns.) It'll shoot the fleas off a dogs back at 500 yards, Tannen, and its pointed straight at your head!! (Tannen motions to his gang and they all lower their guns.) You owe me money, blacksmith. How do ya figure? The thing I really miss here is Tylenol. (A gang member wanders over to check the alley and spots them.) Hey! (Marty runs into Saloon. Doc hides behind some barrels.) Freeze blacksmith! (Train) (The whistle blows as the train finally leaves the station. The bearded man from last night is sitting next to another man directly behind Clara, who is sitting alone.)</p>

                <p>No I didn't! It was a sting operation! I was setting him up! McFly, read my fax! (The words You're Fired appear on screen, and the Jitz walks away.) Please no, I can't be fired - I'm fired! (Fax machines throughout the house print off You're Fired as well. One is near Jennifer. She takes it and look at it, horrified.) (Doc's House) (The camera pans around the place. No one is home.)</p>
